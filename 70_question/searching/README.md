### Selection on the kth element in an unsorted array
- [Selection on finding kth element in linear time](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s14/LectureNotes/median.pdf)

Methods on find kth element:
- Heap sort for best worse case. Stop sorting when index k is sorted. 
- Quick select using quick sort algorithm but only recursively called on the partition where k lies.
- Medium of medium
