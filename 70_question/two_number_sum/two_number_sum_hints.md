## Hints 

### Hint 1
Try using two for loops to sum all possible pairs of numbers in the array.
What are the time and space implications of this approach?

### Hint 2
Find Y such that X + Y = targetSum. 

### Hint 3
Using a hash table for hint 2, checking if Y is stored in the table. 

## Optimal Space & Time Complexity 
Space complexity is O(n) and time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input array.
