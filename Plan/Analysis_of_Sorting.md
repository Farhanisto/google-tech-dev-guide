[Analysis of different sorting techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-different-sorting-techniques/)

Analysis of sorting techniques:
- When the array is almost sorted, insertion sort can be preferred.
- When order of input is not known, merge sort is preferred as it has the worst case time complexity of n log n and it is stable as well.
- When the array is sorted, insertion and bubble sort gives complexity of n but quick sort gives complexity of n^2.
