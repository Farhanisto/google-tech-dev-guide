    <summary>Single Numbers</summary>

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

1. Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. 
2. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

    <summary>Follow Up - Single Numbers II</summary>

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:
1. Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. 
2. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

    <summary>Follow up - Single Numbers III</summary>

Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.  

Example:
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]

Note:
1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
